console.log("" + 1 + 0); // This equals 10 because empty string has the ability to combine two numbers rather than add them and in JavaScript "number" + number equals the two numbers put beside each other.

console.log("" - 1 + 0); // This equals -1 reason being is because the string takes over -1 and the 0 plays no role since the string takes favor of -1

console.log(true + false); // This equals 1 because in JavaScript True is of 1 and False is of 0 which means 1 + 0 = 1

console.log(!true); // This equals False and the reason being is because the expression "!" in boolean logic means the opposite of what is displayed for example !true = False and !false = True.

console.log(6 / "3"); // This equals 2 because in JavaScript the "/" symbol means division.

console.log("2" * "3"); // This equals 6 because the "*" means multiplication and 2 times 3 equals 6.

console.log(4 + 5 + "px"); // This equals 9px and that's because the string "px" is adding to pixels attribute to the solution 4 + 5 which equals 9.

console.log("$" + 4 + 5); // This equals 45$
